    caption: "Perched on the edge of reality, straddling the line between the physical and the ephemeral, resides the Electrospectral Canuckâ€”a ship destined not for sea but for the invisible highways of the airwaves. Its intricate framework pulses with a fusion of bygone charm and modern innovation, adorned with a bold Canadian flag dancing with pride at its heart. By night, its beacons pulsate, guiding travellers through the static fog while its captain navigates unseen seas of frequency, uniting disparate souls through a shared language of curiosity and camaraderie. More than a ham radio station, the Electrospectral Canuck is a vessel sailing the ether, casting ripples of connection across the world."

# I'm Taking Over Clares!

Hello OMs, YLs, radio-folk, and radio enthusiasts! ðŸ‘‹

I've got some exciting news to share with you today. I'm Amin Gilani, VE3EQL on the air, and I've recently taken over the reins at [Clares](clares.ca).  Clares has been everyone's favourite free resource for mastering both Basic and Advanced Canadian amateur radio licenses for the past decade.

First off, let's recognize Al Hatch, VA6HAL, for all his work. Al's the dedicated individual who crafted Clares into the treasure trove it is today, meticulously recording, updating and managing these invaluable courses over the past decade. I know firsthand how helpful Clares is -- I used it to study for my own Basic and Advanced licenses. Al leaves some big shoes and I hope I can fill them.

I'm a software developer from Toronto with a burning passion for amateur radio. Since taking over, I've started making some updates to Clares already, always with the aim of enhancing your learning experience. The site should already feel significantly faster.

But here's my promise to you: while I will strive for continuous improvement, the essence of Clares will remain the same. I want the site to evolve without disrupting your journey. Our goal is to make Clares better, never harder to use.

So, here's to the future of Clares. I can't wait to hear your thoughts and suggestions, and I'm looking forward to growing with you all in our shared passion for ham radio.

73,

Amin, VE3EQL
