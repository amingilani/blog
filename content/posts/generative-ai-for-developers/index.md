  <p class="from-them">Introductory Paragraph</p>
  <p class="from-them">Generative AI is transforming how software development teams approach coding by automating repetitive tasks and streamlining complex processes. For developers working with Python, Django, React, Typescript, Ruby, and DevOps, AI tools offer tangible benefits in terms of increased efficiency and productivity. By assisting with tasks like code generation, bug fixing, and refactoring, generative AI allows developers to focus more on high-impact work while reducing time spent on routine tasks. Integrating these AI-powered tools into existing workflows has the potential to significantly improve development speed and quality, all while maintaining the critical need for human oversight and expertise in the process.</p>

  <p class="from-me">It's too long. Break it up into paragraphs, and reduce where needed.</p>

  <p class="from-them">Generative AI is transforming how developers approach coding by automating repetitive tasks and simplifying complex processes. For teams working with Python, Django, React, Typescript, Ruby, and DevOps, AI tools are driving efficiency and productivity.</p>
  <p class="from-them">By handling tasks like code generation, bug fixing, and refactoring, generative AI reduces the time spent on routine work, allowing developers to focus on more critical challenges. These tools can seamlessly integrate into current workflows, improving both speed and quality.</p>
  <p class="from-them">While AI enhances development, human oversight remains essential. Developers and AI working together can achieve better outcomes, ensuring that quality and creativity are maintained.</p>

Generative AI-â€”I'll just call it AI from here onwards--has transformed the way I approach writing coding. By automating repetitive and boring tasks I improve my efficiency and productivity. For tasks like code generation, refactoring and natural-language driven editing, generative AI reduces the time spent on routine work. I even find it's great to argue with and flesh out my own ideas.

Since writing code is now cheap, I find that I can approach higher level ideas, such as writing _good_ code. Code that is well structured, easy to navigate, efficient, and adheres to the principles of writing good software.

Just remember that while AI enhances your development, human oversight is crucial because the AI doesn't know what it's talking about. You need to ensure that quality is maintained. AI can give you the word soup, it can even strain and refine it into a nicer word soup, but only you can turn it into something palatable.

In this post I'm going to over how I use generative AI and some use cases where it really shines for me.

## Tools I Use

At work I primarily rely on:

* GitHub Copilot integration in my VSCode
* GitHub Copilot Chat integration in my VSCode
* GitHub Copilot integration in the terminal

On my personal machines I use everything I already do at work, plus:

* A paid ChatGPT+ subscription
* A ChatGPT API account
* Zed, an IDE with deep AI integration

Things I have but don't rely on too much:

* Google's Gemma API
* Anthropic's Claude API

I won't be covering how to set any of these they are well documented and always
changing.

## Personal Reasons I Use AI

I'm not neurotypical and so, a lot of my personal reasons may not work for the vast majority of people. However, tech seems to be where all the neurodivergent folk congregate, so you might find these great for you.

* Editing is less exhausting than authoring
* It makes code cheap to write
* It helps gives me feedback to flesh out my ideas
* It finds errors I might not have noticed

## Scenarios Where I Commonly Use AI

We've already covered a scenario. I used
